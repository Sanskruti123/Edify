	<p>Have you noticed the sudden entry of many players in the Indian #e-commerce space? This is because Indian #e-commerce space is moving leaps and bounds, and it is expected to grow by US$ 200 B by 2026. India’s E-commerce revenue is expected to jump from US$ 39 billion in 2017 to US$ 120 billion in 2020, <strong>at an annual growth rate of 51 percent which is the highest in the world</strong>. </p>
	<p>This is a huge market and currently it is dominated by a few big players by #Amazon, #flipkart, #grofers,# bigbasket etc. This boom has been triggered due to the increasing consumer wealth, ongoing #digital #India campaign, increased number of Smartphone users and at last but not the least, cheaper access to the internet to everyone.</p>
	<p>Isn’t it a gigantic figure? Yes obviously it is. But up till what extent? This can be predicted by the fact that India’s richest man #Mukesh #Ambani doesn’t want to be left behind in this business. </p>
	<p>With an aim to dominate this segment, he launched #Jiomart as joint ventures of Reliance retail and #Jio Platforms. Currently #Jiomart is into #online #grocery delivery service which is active in selected areas of Navi Mumbai, Thane, Kalyan. It delivers daily essential and grocery from nearby #kirana stores. An astonishing fact is that within weeks of its launch, <strong>the #Jiomart application has crossed 1 million+ downloads</strong>. </p>
	<p>It is very unlikely for #start-ups to show such kind of phenomenon but all thanks to the #brand #value of #Mukesh Ambani that did more than sufficient marketing for #Jiomart.</p>
	<p><strong>A different approach to order products:</strong></p>
	<p>#Jiomart follows the online to offline business model in which people can order online but get the product offline by reaching directly to the retailers or getting its #home #delivery. </p>
	<p>Apart from ordering from the web app or mobile app, #Jiomart also provides an option to order through #whatsapp. For this the customer has to text ‘Hi’ to the #whatsapp number of #Jiomart i.e. 88500 08000. We just need to select the products and the order will be placed with the nearby #kirana store. Once the items are packed we will get a notification to collect it. Later on #home #delivery services and online payment through #whatsapp will be provided.</p>
	<p>But what was the need to bring a new ordering procedure? I would say this is a very clever move as they are trying to bring in the senior citizens into their user base. </p>
	<p>Many aged person find it tedious to get acquainted with new app and technology but most of them uses #whatsapp in India. With this approach, #Jiomart is trying to get hold of this new user base who are reluctant to use new applications.</p>
	<p><strong>Salient Features of #Jiomart:</strong></p>
	<p>⮚&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<strong>It follows an Online to offline model (O2O).</strong></p><p>⮚&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No minimum value limit for free delivery. All the products will be delivered free of cost.</p>
	<p>⮚&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They will provide quick delivery from the local #kirana stores.</p><p>⮚&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No questions asked return policy: There will be no unnecessary questions asked by the company such as the reason of return etc.</p>
	<p>⮚&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Early Bird #discount offer will be provided by the company to the users those who join early.</p>
	<p><strong>Business Model:</strong></p>
	<p>#Jiomart aims to provide 50,000+ lifestyle and grocery products, besides keeping a competitive price and an express delivery channel. But How?? </p>
	<p>The answer is that they are avoiding the system of warehousing, distribution and logistics by tying up with the local #kirana stores and retailers. This model is called the #O2O (online to offline) model. The requested items by the customers will be procured by the nearest vendor present in the customer’s vicinity</p>
	<p>When we deep dived and studied this model, we found that it is far better than a traditional system as it is cutting down several additional costs of storing, managing and accountation of products, transportation etc. Apart from this, the customers also get faster delivery of their products. These saved amounts will be distributed between the customers, retailers, and the company. This creates a happy chain of customers and retailers.</p>
	<p>Secondly #Jiomart will enable #kiranas and retailers to order from its cash and carry store. This will enable the small businessperson to aggressively price their products. These will not only help the retailers but indirectly #jiomart can reach those users who don’t use #Jiomart.</p>

	<p><strong>Marketing Strategy:</strong></p>
	<p>One of the major causes for the failure of #start-ups is the poor marketing strategy. So, it's very crucial for #jiomart to excel in their strategy inorder to take a lead over its competitors. At the core, #Jiomart is targeting the middle class families through its vision of unbundling and changing marketing habits. The second major thing is they are not imposing any kind of restrictions to the retailers. Let’s try to understand their marketing strategies: </p><p>⮚&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;#Reliance is trying to bring in as many retailers as possible even from the tier 2 and tier 3 cities by giving lucrative offers and flexibility to the retailers. For example get Rs 150 products for Rs19. #Jiomart is also upgrading small shops into mini #supermarket, whose amount has to be repaid by the owner as monthly instalments. Rebranding of the shops name into #Jiomart depends upon the agreement between the shop and Jiomart.&nbsp;</p><p>⮚&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;#Jiomart is also offering huge #discounts on products and mainly on their private label brands such as Best Farms, Masti Oye, Kaffe, Enzo, Mopz, Expelz and Home One to the retailers so that they can offer better #discounts to the customers. But it is not compulsive; the retailers can stock up their products from distributors of their choice.</p>
	<p>⮚&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;#Reliance has recently signed a deal with Facebook. A major pact in this deal was to give the customer’s access to #Jiomart through #Whatsapp. This is a clear strategic advantage of #Jiomart over its competitors like #Grofers, #Bigbasket etc because most of the smartphone users in India use #Whatsapp and thus the probability of using #Jiomart increases over other competitors. This will also help companies to reach the customers who prefer offline shopping through these retail stores.</p>
	<p>&nbsp;⮚&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are no minimum order criteria for #free #delivery. This encourages repetitive buying and eventually it will increase the buying capacity of customers. This will also bring in the customers with lesser buying capacity.</p>
	<p>⮚&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;#Jiomart is giving face masks and sanitizers for the first order of the customer. This step looks to be simple enough but it creates a good will for the company among the customers.</p><p>⮚&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<strong>One more point worth noting is the utilisation of #COVID-19 by its mentor #Mukesh #Ambani</strong>. He launched #Jiomart during this #Pandemic situation as most of the customers are shifting towards online shopping as a preventive measure against corona virus.</p>
	<p>⮚&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;#Jiomart bought #Future #groups. #Future #group’s Big Bazaar, Central has its chain all across the major cities of India. This deal will provide a vast range of products to the customers. This seems that #Jiomart is trying to establish a monopoly.</p>
	<p><strong>Jio And Jiomart:</strong></p>
	<p>We all have witnessed the revolution in the Indian #telecom sector brought about by #Jio. The #digitisation of India would not be possible without #Jio. #Mukesh #Ambani’s ambition of having a hold in the #IT sector is clearly evident. His ventures on #Jio, #Jiomeet, Jio browser, #Jiopay etc is clearly stating his ambition.&nbsp;The growth of #IT and e-commerce sector is tremendous and he does not want to miss this opportunity<strong>. </strong></p>
	<p><strong>#Jio has showed its domination by capturing nearly 35% of the market and that too in a record period of time</strong>. Will it be the same case with #Jiomart? I guess yes. But at the same time it’s an alarming situation for its competitors. </p>
	<p><strong>&nbsp;Are we approaching a market monopoly?</strong></p>
	<p><strong>As of now, #Jiomart has crossed 5million+ downloads in play stores. </strong>This is a huge response for any start-up. This is all because of the brand value of #Mukesh #Ambani. But is it a peril approaching the other start-ups like #grofers, #bigbasket etc? We are aware of the destruction caused by #Jio in the telecom sector that forced many companies like docomo, telenor to close their operations and many players like #Idea, #Vodafone with huge cash flow are finding it difficult to continue their operations.</p>
	<p>In the case of #Jiomart, other #e-grocery stores are merely having the required capital to stand up against #Jiomart. The big players are in their nascent stage or are yet to start. So it seems that a monopoly of #Jiomart can be set up in the near future.</p>
	<p>&nbsp;<strong>CONCLUSION:</strong></p>
	<p>#Reliance presence in the field of electronics, lifestyle, fashion and grocery stores is highly prominent and spread all across India. Now they want to dominate the ecommerce space with #Jiomart. Theoretically this model checks most of the boxes for a #successful #start-ups.</p>
	<p>&nbsp;<strong>But at same time we must not forget that it is estimated that almost 90% of start-ups fail every year globally</strong>. Do you know the major reason behind it? </p>
	<p>It’s not the #idea or #funding problem. It is the implementation of the #idea, moreover making #evolution, innovation out of any basic thought, which most of the start-ups don’t take into account. But this completely depends on the mentor of the company and in #Jiomart’s case it’s the Indian business tycoon #Mukesh #Ambani. We are evident of the disruption created by #Jio in the telecom Industry and I have a strong feeling that I will see another disruption in the e-commerce space.</p>
	<p><strong>So, are you willing to embark on this journey from scaling to trending? Do you wish to scale your business up even in highly competitive conditions?
