			<p>Hey readers, did you get confused after reading the title, moreover the word revolution? To clear all your doubts this article won’t be focusing over any historical revolution.</p><br>
			<p>Then what does the revolution exactly mean here? It’s the revolution in the business world. Not just a revolution, but here you will read about the evolution of an idea as well.</p><br>
			<i>
				<p>It is estimated that almost 90% of startups fail every year globally.</p>
			</i><br>
			<p>Do you know the major reason behind it? It’s not the idea or funding problem. Its implementation of the idea, moreover making evolution, innovation out of any basic thought, which most of the startups don’t take into account.</p><br>
			<p>So, are you eager to hear about this evolutionary idea? Do you want to know about the journey of a simple startup to a robust business? Let’s get started.</p><br>
			<p>Past few years, a kind of revolution has taken place in the global business. It is also happening in every small and big sector, which may be a basic necessity or a rich luxury to humans. Same is the case with the grocery products, the items which run basic necessity of any family. If we look back in the history, the groceries constitute daily need items which need to be purchased on a daily, weekly or monthly basis. Today, everyone is living a fast, sedentary lifestyle. Sometimes, regular shopping for daily chore items becomes difficult for most of us.</p><br>
			<p>And this convention of buying face-to-face physically is changing due to the technology driven environment. Online grocery shops all over the globe has made our life much more comfortable. Grocery startups in India have turned out to be a blessing for many families, especially where both the partners are working and hardly get any time to go to the market.</p><br>
			<p>In India, people took some time to accept this brand-new concept of online Grocery shopping. Indians generally preferred to hop from shop to shop and bargain for the quality products at the minimal price. But as the time flew, Indians also realised that ordering groceries online not only saved their time and effort but also helped them get the quality items at affordable cost. Having such a bright aim in mind, an online grocery delivery Startup was started in 2013 which is now famous as Grofers.</p><br>

		</b>

		<div style="text-align: center; text-align: justify;
  text-justify: inter-word;">
			<p>India-based Grofers is a hyper-local online platform that delivers groceries, fruits and vegetables, cosmetics, and electronics. It was founded by Albinder Dhindsa and Saurabh Kumar. Albinder completed his Bachelors from IITD and further pursued MBA from Columbia university, while Saurabh graduated from IITB and did his MS in University of Texas. Before opening of Grocers, both the founders had worked at high profile posts. Albinder joined as the head of international operations while Saurabh worked with Opera Solutions as a COO.</p><br>
			<p>Later, both of them met and carried their work at Cambridge Systematics. After both of them left the job there, they discovered a huge gap in the logistics or delivery industry and could sense a crucial untapped opportunity. Hence, they quickly got together again and start working on the idea and laid the foundation for their startup.</p><br>

		<p style="clear: both">In 2013, they launched an app named Onenumber. It aimed to provide an on-demand pickup & drop service from the pharmacies, groceries, and restaurants for a customer. It was basically a one-stop solution for customers’ local delivery needs. Soon they realised that 90% of their orders are for grocery items and pharmacy products. Hence, they changed their model and focused only on groceries and pharmacy, thus rebranding themselves as Grofers. In short, the founders had the courage to adapt as per their customer needs and develop themselves accordingly, which they did and then Grofers was born.</p><br>
		<p>But why was the startup rebranded Grofers? Grofers is nothing but a portmanteau i.e. the blend of two words grocery and gophers. The blend of two words would simply mean a grocery gopher person i.e. a grocery delivering person.</p><br>
		<b>
			<p>Business Model-</p>
		</b><br>
		<p>As mentioned above, Grofers was just started with the help of an app-based service to cater the delivery problems of necessary items of people. After numerous introspection, adaptation of a strong methodology and deterministic policy, the founders rebranded their startup by focusing their attention towards grocery items and pharmacy products, thus delivering products at customers’ call.</p><br>
		<p>At the very initial stage, it just started as an online platform that helped to order groceries, bakery products, fruits, and vegetables. At present, it acts as a low-price online supermarket that allows customers to order products across varied categories like grocery, vegetables, beauty & wellness, household care, baby care, pet care and meats & seafood and gets them delivered to their doorstep.</p><br>
