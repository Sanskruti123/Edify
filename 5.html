<p>Hey readers, I hope you all are initially safe and then doing well. With this pandemic period still prevailing around, we all are very well aware that most of the businesses, to be specific, some recently built startups have suffered a lot. So, <strong>what should a budding entrepreneur do in such circumstances?</strong></p>
<p>To begin, there’s a very famous maxim by Charles Darwin which is applicable to everyone, even the nature acts accordingly.</p>
<strong>It is not the strongest or the most intelligent who will survive, but those who can best manage <em>change</em>.</strong>
<p>I guess, you all might be confused of how this maxim is related to the Startup ideas. But to your amaze, this quote is perfectly applicable to any business working under simple-critical situations.</p>
<p>But what exact idea does this maxim offer 🤔?</p>
<p>It doesn’t indicate any novel idea, but a very common human instinct of ‘<strong>adaptation</strong>’. And adaptation, making changes considering the situations around, is one of the key aspects which everybody in this pandemic situation must accept.</p>
<p>Such situations would make people, to be specific ‘<em>the Startup builders</em>’, <strong>change their aim</strong> itself. But without losing any hope, one must <strong>aim for the change</strong> instead of acting vice-versa.</p>
<p>So, are you eager to explore such bountiful, common yet significant life lessons to build up? Do you want the startup builder beneath you to rise, if every you wish to open your own startup? Then <strong>do read this blog till the end</strong> and <strong>comment your views</strong> thereafter.</p>
<p>Before moving to the solutions, let’s take a quick view of the <strong>problem</strong> itself.</p>
<h2><strong><u>COVID-19 Impact on Startups-</u></strong></h2><br>
<div class="text-center">
<img src="https://media-exp1.licdn.com/dms/image/C4D12AQHeTpwtjKj0CQ/article-inline_image-shrink_1000_1488/0?e=1607558400&v=beta&t=zPqB116pCsVZaLP9wuwheRh94Ql4IPRCPDz2f2XeOAo" style="max-height: 500px; max-width: 500px; ">
		</div>
<p style="clear: both">The Indian startup ecosystem – hitherto heralded for its rapid growth – is facing its biggest challenge till now, with its very survival at stake due to the COVID-19 crisis. The very core reason behind this is not the efficiency in execution of ideas, but the cash runaway &amp; funding problems.</p>
<p>Did you know 😲: </p>
<blockquote>According to NASSCOM’s month long e-survey, <strong>40% </strong>of the startups in India have temporarily shut down operations or are on the verge of shutting down.</blockquote>
<div class="text-center">
<img src="https://media-exp1.licdn.com/dms/image/C4D12AQHuumbHjvNn_w/article-inline_image-shrink_1000_1488/0?e=1607558400&v=beta&t=CkpwXW957dPTFY3BKJYT-iXhlvasXQND2qtJ41j0hw0" style="max-height: 500px; max-width: 500px; ">
		</div>
<p style="clear: both">Thus, one of the major challenges faced by the start-ups has now become sourcing funds, which has resulted in cash flow issues, for many. The lock-down has not only impacted the daily business operations, but it has also forced a many good start-ups into preparing for contingency plans to limit workforce and to cut down employee salaries. Various start-up founders have also taken pay-cuts to limit the losses faced.</p>
<h2><strong><u>Action plan for Startups-</u></strong></h2><br>
<p>As stated in the introductory phase of this article, every startup should take these phases as growth period, and adapt the changes. For instance, whenever strong winds blow up, the trees around don’t challenge them. The trees just politely bend down (this doesn’t mean surrendering) and flow along with the wind. And after the wind is gone, the trees again stand upright with pride in the sky. Similarly, be prepared for the worst situation (at present, the pandemic); then readjust if the situation starts improving faster.</p>
<p>Startups must assume these three main things at prior viz. <strong>delayed receivables</strong>, <strong>consumer price cuts on offered services</strong> and <strong>less probability in closing of contracts at last minute</strong>. By considering this all, one must work accordingly.</p>
<p>Following can be considered as one of the <strong><em>ideal action plan</em></strong> to follow by any startup.</p>
<div class="text-center">
<img src="https://media-exp1.licdn.com/dms/image/C4D12AQGyU1xTURwaRw/article-inline_image-shrink_1000_1488/0?e=1607558400&v=beta&t=ai7_QTJs3WH4kCv3NR5aIAm7DdA2C6mJ7mHZblW5X3E"  style="max-height: 500px; max-width: 500px; ">
		</div>
<p style="clear: both">The periods included in above plan is in respect to the prevailing pandemic period. In this plan, the periods may vary, but steps to be executed mostly remain intact.</p>
<p>Following is a short descriptive summary of all the above stages/ periods that startup may undergo.</p>
<p>1. <strong>Survival Period: </strong>The name given to this stage completely describes what a startup should act. This period being the initialisation of startup to undergo the challenging situation, the most significant step is to continue the sole existence of startup, with enough financial resources, and without any pending costs, debts, etc. The time for this period may vary between 2-3 months.</p><br>
<div class="slate-resizable-image-embed slate-image-embed__resize-full-width"><img alt="No alt text provided for this image" data-media-urn="" data-li-src="https://media-exp1.licdn.com/dms/image/C4D12AQG8UXz8jjKcnw/article-inline_image-shrink_1000_1488/0?e=1607558400&amp;v=beta&amp;t=jTY2x-cCZqzNYlfRDXHaamwI-76lRodk1ZsB5-rQqCc" src="https://media-exp1.licdn.com/dms/image/C4D12AQG8UXz8jjKcnw/article-inline_image-shrink_1000_1488/0?e=1607558400&amp;v=beta&amp;t=jTY2x-cCZqzNYlfRDXHaamwI-76lRodk1ZsB5-rQqCc"></div>
<br>
<p>Thus, if any startup survives this period of the situation, there are much more chances of it to overcome the challenge it is facing.</p>
<p><strong>2. Switching Period:</strong> After the initial step, the startup may assess some threats that situation has posed for its business. For this, the startup must analyse these threats properly and eliminate them with present/ new solutions. And it is this period wherein the startup will decide the exact journey through this situation. This period will vary between 2-3 months but is a very crucial stage from decision making point of view.</p><br>
<div class="slate-resizable-image-embed slate-image-embed__resize-full-width"><img alt="No alt text provided for this image" data-media-urn="" data-li-src="https://media-exp1.licdn.com/dms/image/C4D12AQG0xe9cPkRCEQ/article-inline_image-shrink_1000_1488/0?e=1607558400&amp;v=beta&amp;t=kZeDe4CBnAffDDaZMTI2CiPtnlFYsKFEVvctbmrTPg0" src="https://media-exp1.licdn.com/dms/image/C4D12AQG0xe9cPkRCEQ/article-inline_image-shrink_1000_1488/0?e=1607558400&amp;v=beta&amp;t=kZeDe4CBnAffDDaZMTI2CiPtnlFYsKFEVvctbmrTPg0"></div>
<br>
<p>The pivoting of the startup is the most important step of this period. Startup must consider various factors affecting it at the present, do proper value-stream analysis and then pitch the idea relating to it.</p><br>
<p><strong>3. Execution &amp; Marketing Period: </strong>This period will continue for almost 1-2 months and will mark the termination of the challenging situation. At this stage, the work load over startup will increase, and the risk will increase as well. So, proper execution of ideas must be done as planned by startups.</p><br>
<div class="slate-resizable-image-embed slate-image-embed__resize-full-width"><img alt="No alt text provided for this image" data-media-urn="" data-li-src="https://media-exp1.licdn.com/dms/image/C4D12AQEX1uCyRORQ4A/article-inline_image-shrink_1000_1488/0?e=1607558400&amp;v=beta&amp;t=Bqv36ua4jF-TVWp8ZR9HRxrXrlUll_QcLpfqA1nx1PQ" src="https://media-exp1.licdn.com/dms/image/C4D12AQEX1uCyRORQ4A/article-inline_image-shrink_1000_1488/0?e=1607558400&amp;v=beta&amp;t=Bqv36ua4jF-TVWp8ZR9HRxrXrlUll_QcLpfqA1nx1PQ"></div>
<br>
<p><strong>4. Growth Period: </strong>This is just a small period wherein the startup may able to view the outcomes of its efforts. As per the outcomes, one may assess the business as a success or failure. Even if there is not any appreciable profit obtained over this situation, the startup should be applauded for its work. The journey thereafter depends upon the market, competitors, pivoting strategy implemented and many such factors.</p><br>
<p>So, to summarise this whole process in few lines, the process must initiate as soon as the challenging situation arises. All the actions must be taken under proper guidance of experienced mentors. Startups may also inspire from their competitors and try to innovate their plans as well. Following is a small pictographic representation of the whole.</p>
<div class="text-center">
<img src="https://media-exp1.licdn.com/dms/image/C4D12AQEFnRUVT8l48A/article-inline_image-shrink_1000_1488/0?e=1607558400&v=beta&t=WWx2vGows5kL5sLl2BY7yjRhPdAJDAcddt8WqM9Rfw0" style="max-height: 500px; max-width: 500px; ">
		</div>
<br>
<p style="clear: both">As the situation tries to lower its impacts, the startup may stop executing this action plan and set the journey thereafter. At the end, the caretakers of the startup have a large responsibility over them, so proper guidance, consultation and mentoring must be taken by them from various sources throughout this plan.</p><br>
<h2><strong><u>Some key points to sustain COVID-</u></strong></h2><br>
<p>1. Every startup must utilise the financial resources viably. For instance: During this COVID times, the conventional marketing techniques like hoardings, newspaper ads, etc. don’t have great demand. Instead of such high cost marketing techniques, one could opt a pocket friendly, cheap yet effective technique. Startups may turn to collaborations, may offer free demo sessions over their services, etc.</p><br>
<p>2. The startup firm can look at this particular situation as a new opportunity to discover different sub-fields in their segment. For instance: During this COVID times, a technology startup can make innovations in the health-care segment. Also, startups in segment of education, finance and mainly agriculture have started rising in past few years.</p><br>
<p>3. The new startups that have recently build up won’t have to pay extra allowances like employee seat costs and thus can save a lot of financial resources.</p><br>
<p>4. A startup, by ignoring the profitability up to certain extent can look up for other options like collaboration with other co-businesses, may look up for opening some new offers thereby attracting consumers.</p><br>
<p>5. A startup must plan things as per the customer-centric approach. One must not search customer for one’s products, but must try to provide the best possible product to customer.</p><br>
<h2><strong><u>Startups that stood ideal this pandemic-&nbsp;</u></strong></h2><br>
<p>1.&nbsp;<em><u>Multiliving Technologies Pvt. Ltd</u></em>.- This startup provides a unique platform-based business to its clients in the segment of rental estates. This lockdown, their services were hugely supported by technology which helped their brand unlock enhanced rental value in the extremely large residential real estate asset class by creating a rental housing ecosystem through technology, enriching the lives of both tenants &amp; owners in their respective value chains. By continuing its unique offerings, the company didn’t lose any of its clients, moreover its homeowner customer base increased a lot. Besides all this, the workspace of the company mainly consisted of easy WFH tools given to its employees. As a result of which, the company neither faced any layoff issues nor there were any salary cuts.</p><br>
<p>2.&nbsp;<em><u>CloudConnect Communications</u></em>- CCCPL is a new startup and India's first regulatory licensed Virtual Network Operator (VNO) poised to revolutionise and redefine Mobile First Business Communication and Team Collaboration in India. This lockdown has favoured this startup a lot and helped it digitalize small and medium enterprises (SMEs), very small businesses (VSBs) and small office home office (SOHO) setups that form the very backbone of the economy. They have seen 100% growth in their business as they provide remote working solutions and lockdown is all about working from home i.e. remote working.</p><br>
<p><em>3. <u>Khabri</u></em>- Launched in October 2017, it is the first pureplay audio platform to discover, listen and create audio content in an Indian vernacular. &nbsp;In this current scenario where many corporates are doing cost-cutting, Khabri India is sponsoring many Skills Enhancement courses. Besides this, the lockdown period has helped many people enhance their hobbies and Khabri has gained much during the COVID-19 lockdown as people working from home are doubling down on their hobbies to create content online. This startup knew the potential of tier-2, tier-3 and rural cities of India, thereby has attracted the content creators from those areas. In short, Khabri has started building “You tube like platform for audio content”.</p><br>
