			<p>After the trend set up by global business tycoons like Mark Zuckerberg, Jeff Bezos, etc., many young tech-enthusiasts started dreaming of a new concept ‘Startup and Entrepreneurship’. But most of these enthusiasts severely fail every year, not because these startups aren’t funded. Do you know the major reason behind all this? The very initial reason is the execution of the idea, the kind of implementation needed.</p><br>
			<p>But this is just a single step. One may never know when his/ her startup may break down. Do you know which vital concepts differentiate a startup by its profitability and loss incurred? Do you know what effective tools every startup has been using to sustain itself in this ruthless business world? It’s nothing but the technology used and marketing tools implemented.</p><br>
			<p>Are you familiar with these terms? If yes, then you must explore more about this here and if not, then you must read this article! So, let’s get started.</p><br>
			<p>As we all know, Grofers has brought a great revolution in startup segment. The concept of online grocery store was unknown until Grofers was born. But, with very strong competitors like Big Basket, Ninja cart, etc. and the dawn of Amazon Now in the country, Grofers did lose an appreciable amount of its clients’ community. But, do you know what kept this online supermarket sustain in this competition? Are you aware about how this startup has been successful in getting funding? This credit goes to the technology that is used by the Grofers to serve its customers, which is nothing but real-time implementation of idea. Not only technology, but also Grofers has been really great in marketing its products and service. Past few years, their marketing has proven to be the backbone of the company’s income. So, want to dive deep into the technology used by Grofers and their marketing strategy? For this, do read this article till the end. </p><br>
			<u>
				<p>Technology & Functioning-</p>
			</u>
			<p>Grofers has tied-up with merchants and stores in local areas of many major cities. Grofers allows these stores or merchants to have more customers through their app usage and they charge some commission (8%-15%).</p><br>
			<b>
				<p>Grofers charges 8% on order below ₹700 and 12%-15% commission on orders below ₹1,000.</p>
			</b>
			<p>When Grofers launched in 2013, the logistics system was entirely manual. Staff at the headquarters called delivery drivers with order details and delivery addresses. Drivers then decided what order to pick up goods from local merchants. With a small number of customers and orders, that wasn’t a problem. But the manual system couldn’t handle growth. Grofers recognized that it had to automate the system.</p><br>
			<p>To do that, it turned to Google Cloud Platform. Grofers built a new back end for its delivery system using App Engine. When an order arrives, the new system looks at the status of all drivers — including their current location, the order he’s completing, and the pickup and delivery locations on the route. Based on that information, the system calculates the optimal driver for each order and sends the driver the order via a mobile app.</p><br>
			<p>For proper performance of this app, several other technology services and products like HTML 5, Google Analytics, and j Query is used by Grofers.</p><br>
			<b>
				<p>Did you know that: Grofers apps generally have over 4Lakh monthly downloads at an average. Some most popular apps downloaded are Grofers - Order Grocery online, Grofers - Online Grocery, and GrofersGo Delivery Partner App.</p>
			</b><br>
			<p>Besides all this, Grofers is also actively using 83 technologies for its website. These include SSL by Default, Apple Mobile Web Clips Icon, and WordPress.</p><br>
			<b>
				<p>Grofers website is ranked 20,275 among websites globally based on its 1,690,388 monthly web visitors. </p>

	<u>
		<p>Marketing strategy & key promotions-</p>
	</u><br>
	<p>Grofers follows a <b>market leader pricing</b> in its marketing mix where it offers free delivery to the customer over a certain minimum amount of orders, else it charges a fixed rate for delivery. Grofers offers periodic sales discounts on certain ranges of products to gain customer orders in those product segments. The company prices the product competitively as it faces stiff competition from other similar platform providers like Big Basket and Local Banya. Grofers has tie ups with credit card and other money transaction companies and provides periodic discounts to those company’s cardholders and payment gateways users.</p>
	<p>The promotional and advertising strategy in the Grofers marketing strategy is as follows:</p><br>
	<p>Grofers has used TV commercial ad films to promote its brand. The TV ads are focused on two aspects of the company,</p><br>
	<ol type="1">
		<li>Central Brand</li>
		<li>Service Features of the brand</li>
	</ol>
	<p>The company ad campaigns are targeted towards working couples who find it hard to make balance between their personal and professional lives. Grofers also utilises paid media like print ads on newspaper advertising some sale on its app or unique product offerings. Grofers focuses on providing on time good delivery services as it is central to their brand promotion. Digital media platforms like YouTube films are well exploited by the company to promote itself. Company is also present on social media platforms like Twitter and Facebook. It uses its page on these sites to create buzz ads, acquiring higher recall in customer mind space.</p><br>
	<p>A few online platforms that could be of use to Grofers’ online reputation management (ORM) could be Instructables, Quora, Blurt It, Answerbag.com and Yahoo Answers. These platforms help the customers share their reviews of Grofers’ services and therefore spread the word!</p><br>
	<p>Platforms like Quora and Yahoo Answers often include questions like ‘Would you buy your fruits and vegetables online?’ and other similar queries. It has to be made sure that Grofers’ is included in answers to all of these questions on said platforms! This increases the likelihood that, when someone searches something relevant, the Quora question with Grofers’ as the answer would be the top answer!</p><br>
	<ul>
		<p>COVID-19 Stories-</p>
	</ul>
	<ul>
		<li>The corona virus outbreak has thrown up a massive opportunity for India’s online grocers. Taking up this opportunity, Grofers has started executing its ideas. The startup turned over to its warehouse facility so that they could store inventories for genuine customers.</li>
		<li>Grofers saw nearly 80% growth in orders across Mumbai, Bengaluru, Pune, and Ahmedabad in recent weeks, and a 60% spike in Delhi National Capital Region (NCR) and Hyderabad. The company also mentioned that the number of orders on Grofers was 45% higher than regular days, while the average order value has increased by 18%.</li>
		<li>While the some of the selfish retailers soared the prices of basic amenities, Grofers did offer products to their genuine customers at very reasonable cost. For instance, it sold all the N95 face masks that it had in stock at Rs. 90 ($1.20) even when some shopkeepers in the country were charging up to Rs. 500.</li>
		<li>Also, during this pandemic period, the Grofers app saw the orders of over 1.5 million people daily. But, instead of opting to profitability, the company just served 1 out of 8 customers.</li>
		<li>The company CEO also mentioned that they had resumed operations in 24 cities and their warehouses were working at 70% strength. The company is also planning to hire an additional 5,000 people who were hired from industries that were deeply impacted by the current crisis such as textile, manufacturing, and services and would have otherwise faced income losses.</li>

	</ul>
	<u>
		<p>Unique Features-</p>
	</u>
	<ul>
