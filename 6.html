For entrepreneurs, the success is just a time instance, while they care for the learning through the failure faced. But every difficulty doesn’t come to make you fail. For some, it’s an opportunity; a chance to grow, to scale and set up a trend.</p>
<p>So, do you want to get acquainted with the very strategy of scaling up? Do you wish to stand out in the market even if it is saturated with many competitors?</p>
<p>For knowing all this, you must surely know about this new yet popular startup- the White Hat Jr.. So, what exactly is this White Hat Jr.?</p>
<p>Introduction-</p>
	<div class="text-center">
	<img src="https://media-exp1.licdn.com/dms/image/C4D12AQHtHtgk-UN2rg/article-inline_image-shrink_1500_2232/0?e=1607558400&v=beta&t=oPElAm2b107wSNk8i0u6GASfHt_rJriqZBVB-l5-eCQ" class="" style="max-height: 500px; max-width: 500px; ">

<p>White Hat Jr. is a Mumbai based EdTech startup by Mr. Karan Bajaj that focuses on training and getting young kids acquainted to computer coding. It is an online platform made for children (ages 6 to 18) to learn programming and are then encouraged to create games, animations and applications. The startup works with a live 1:1 online teaching format and a thoroughly researched curriculum. The subjects range from data structure, app and game development to machine learning and space technology.</p>
<p>Being an online platform, it connects kids aged 6-18 to some of the top early childhood coding teachers, from the comfort of one’s home. The teachings mainly include fundamentals of coding logic, structure and algorithmic thinking, which enables kids to generate creative outcomes.</p>
<blockquote style="article"><strong><em>“This startup is basically on a mission to empower a whole generation to become creators and not just the consumers of technology.”</em></strong></blockquote>
	<br>
<h3><strong>History &amp; origin-</strong></h3><br>
<p>After the startup did became famous, founder Mr. Bajaj shared his views about early childhood learnings. He said that he is a father of two daughters and that he experienced the power of early teachings so as to harness more natural creativity from young kids. Mr. Bajaj, being associated with many powerful & reputed organisations like P&G, BCG and Kraft Foods; he thus wanted to create an ecosystem effective of producing market-ready products just out of kids’ productivity.</p>

			</div>
<p>The name White Hat Jr. was intentionally given to this startup. Mr. Bajaj thought that the kids that would be trained under this startup would turn out to be the junior ‘White Hat’ (legal hacker), who would be a link between creativity and market, as such legal hackers prove to be a link to identify weak points for many companies.</p><br>
<h3><strong>Funding excursion &amp; startup team-</strong></h3><br>
<p>White Hat Jr. has acquired a total funding galore of $1.3Mn until its 2 rounds funding viz. seed round and Series A. White Hat Jr. is currently funded by 3 investors, namely Nexus Venture Partners, Omidyar Network and Owl Ventures, amongst which the latter two are the recent investors of the startup.</p><br>

			</div>
<p>Thereafter, many top venture capitals, private equity and sovereign funds started evaluating a potential investment in Mumbai-based educational technology startup WhiteHat Jr, showcasing ongoing investor interest in one of the few sectors to have made headway despite the Covid-19 pandemic.</p>
<p>Finally, it was on August 5, 2020, when this 18-month startup was acquired by India’s largest Ed-tech company, Byjus under the cash deal of $300Mn.</p>

			</div>
<p>At present, this startup has one current team member, the founder & CEO Mr. Karan Bajaj. Besides this, the board members and advisors for this startup are John Azubuike and Amit Patel.</p>
<h3><strong>Technology-</strong></h3><br>
<p>WhiteHat Jr. is actively using 93 technologies for its website, according to <a href="https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/builtwith" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener"><strong>BuiltWith</strong></a>. These include Viewport Meta, iPhone / Mobile Compatible, and Google Analytics. WhiteHat Jr. is ranked 24,304 among websites globally based on its 2,089,153 monthly web visitors, according to <a href="https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/similarweb" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener"><strong>SimilarWeb</strong></a>.</p><br>
<h3><strong>Journey &amp; milestones-</strong> &nbsp;</h3><br>
<p>The initial phase of this startup was just similar to the other startups. Even tough Mr. Bajaj had worked with some big companies in stints successively, he had to face similar problems, rather to some low extent, which other startup builders would face. But with his prior experience in the corporate business, Mr. Bajaj knew that startups aren’t just built out of a unique idea. He rather thought that a startup built out of a simple, common problem, closed to public, would really provoke market towards his startup.</p>
<p>As mentioned above, this startup was all about the inspiration he received from his two kid daughters. He took this early learning problem into focus, thought about various perspectives, found a simple, optimal solution and then pitched the idea. To relate, he found the solution to harness the creativity from kids in early learning days and facilitated it by the help of coding skills. And in case of pitching, he then raised his at-present successful startup in the EdTech space.</p>
<p>Mr. Bajaj wasn’t a perfect entrepreneur, but neither he was a man with conventional thoughts. He knew that AI will play a significant role further in 21st Century and many new markets will open in future related to its applications. Thus, he pitched the idea of building this application developers and played a blinder role in the phase 1.</p>
<p><strong><em>Milestone 1: The result of the journey and planning done till now started giving fruitful results to Mr. Bajaj. He acquired a seed fund of $1.3Mn from Nexus Venture Partners and Omidyar Network.&nbsp;</em></strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>Now, the phase 2 of the startup had begun. Mr. Bajaj had decided to use this initial traction to hire 8-10 excellent teachers on board. With proper forethought, necessary training to the teachers, this EdTech startup was ready to embark on its journey. The startup was designed such that the consumer/ client, i.e. kids would get the service i.e. teaching from the comfort of their home.</p>
<p>Mr. Bajaj did take care of the problem of the rote learning and pedagogy in the school. The schools had no choice but to engage a class full of 30-40 students with a single teacher for a specific time. For this, the startup opened up a platform of 1:1 live teaching-learning session. This session was more of an interactive and kids’ talk session, rather being a monotonous lecture.</p>
<p><strong><em>Milestone 2: The kids started enjoying this platform and the learning slots started pre-booked. The slots got full up and many students were into the waitlist. Besides this all, many venture capitals had an eye on EdTech space for investments. White Hat Jr. was doing good and thus was approached again by previous investors and a Silicon Valley based EdTech VC Owl Ventures joined in. Thus, Series A funding of $10Mn was successfully obtained by this startup. &nbsp;</em></strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>The investors were really heartened to invest in such a startup that had a great impact over kids. The new funds from Series A round were used to strengthen their technology platform, expand the course curriculum as well as increase consumer awareness. In the successive months, White Hat Jr. started returning profits to its investors and at the same time started on boarding some teachers with great skills. The company started conducting over 1,000 live online classes daily experienced resounding demand with all capacity regularly booked within an hour of being announced and maintaining a daily waitlist of 500 students.</p>
<p>Now, as the year 2020 came forward, the COVID-19 pandemic had started throwing off its bad colors. Many businesses (both big and small) suffered globally. But EdTech space became more resistant in this miserable pandemic. With the closing of schools &amp; educational institutes, students had to sit under the closed doors. This was a golden opportunity for this startup to scale up more and reach to new heights. This startup started offering numerous, innovative courses to kids over certain age groups that upskilled coding activities. This startup, at that time, had an annual run rate of <strong>$75Mn</strong>.</p>
<p><strong><em>Milestone 3: In August 2020, the startup was finally acquired by the Indian EdTech giant and unicorn startup Byju’s at a $300Mn cash deal. </em></strong></p>
<p>This proved to be a real turning point for White Hat Jr. and now the startup has a run rate of <strong>$150Mn</strong>.</p>
<h3><strong>Lessons &amp; learnings-</strong></h3>
<p>1.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A unique idea is not needed to built up a startup. It can be a simple idea solving the common yet right problem faced.</p>
<p>2.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Even if the market is saturated, focusing on right problems and building ideas help a lot.</p>
<p>3.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Once opened, the startup must start taking small risks to scale faster.</p>
<p>4.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Every startup must keep attracting the investors by executing their plans and further ideas.</p>
<p>5.The quality of the product/ service offered by the startup must be maintained.</p>
